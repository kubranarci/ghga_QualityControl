# `ghga-de/aqua`: Contributing Guidelines

Hi there!
Many thanks for taking an interest in improving ghga-de/aqua.

We try to manage the required tasks for ghga-de/aqua using GitHub issues, you probably came to this page when creating one.
Please use the pre-filled template to save time.

However, don't be put off by this template - other more general issues and suggestions are welcome!
Contributions to the code are even more welcome ;)

## Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for ghga-de/aqua, the standard workflow is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [ghga-de/aqua issues](https://github.com/ghga-de/aqua/issues) to avoid duplicating work. If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [ghga-de/aqua repository](https://github.com/ghga-de/aqua) to your GitHub account
3. Submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).

## Tests

You have the option to test your changes locally by running the pipeline. For receiving warnings about process selectors and other `debug` information, it is recommended to use the debug profile. Execute all the tests with the following command:

```bash
nf-test test --profile debug,test,docker --verbose
```

When you create a pull request with changes, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will run automatic tests.
Typically, pull-requests are only fully reviewed when these tests are passing, though of course we can help out before then.

There are typically two types of tests that run:

### Lint tests

`nf-core` has a [set of guidelines](https://nf-co.re/developers/guidelines) which all pipelines must adhere to.
To enforce these and ensure that all pipelines stay in sync, we have developed a helper tool which runs checks on the pipeline code. This is in the [nf-core/tools repository](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) and once installed can be run locally with the `nf-core pipelines lint <pipeline-directory>` command.

If any failures or warnings are encountered, please follow the listed URL for more documentation.

## Patch

:warning: Only in the unlikely and regretful event of a release happening with a bug.

- On your own fork, make a new branch `patch` based on `upstream/main` or `upstream/master`.
- Fix the bug, and bump version (X.Y.Z+1).
- Open a pull-request from `patch` to `main`/`master` with the changes.
